                                <p>Stan is born as Stanley Martin Leiber on December 22, 1922 to Romanian immigrants
                                    Jack and Celia Leiber in New York, New

                                <p>Over a period of many years, Stan loved to read story's like The Hardy Boys and
                                    seeing movies with his family. The Great
                                    Depression hits and Stan's parents lose their jobs and are forced to move into a
                                    much smaller home. Stan still continues
                                    to read and eventually gets out of school at a very young age.

                                <h3>Stan's time at Timely comics</h3>
                                <p>
                                    At only age 17, Stan is hired as, he liked to joke, a "gopher" for Timely Comics
                                    Inc. Stan's job was to bring paint for
                                    empty containers, fetch the CEO's lunch and to wait for the next complaint from the
                                    artists. In 1940, Timely creates the
                                    star spangled hero, Captain America because of the opposing threat of the Nazis. One
                                    day, the artists get so mad with
                                    each other that they quit, including the editor. In 1941, Stan is hired as the
                                    editor for Timely at only age 19!

                                <p>
                                    Stan is enlisted in World War 2. Surprisingly, he does not fight with a weapon. He
                                    fights with cartoons! Stan draws
                                    funny cartoons to cheer up soldiers and give hope to family's. When the war is over,
                                    Stan returns home.

                                    Stan gets married to a British woman named Joan in 1947. Stan later joked that when
                                    he first met her, he blurted out "I
                                    love you" and he later regretted saying that.

                                    After having two children, Joan Celia Lee and Jan Lee (who died only a week after
                                    birth), Stan decides to think of new
                                    creative ideas for new heroes. This eventually leads up to the creation of The
                                    Fantastic Four in the month of November,
                                    1961.

                        In the late 1950s, DC Comics editor Julius Schwartz revived the superhero archetype and
                        experienced
                        a significant
                        success with its updated version of the Flash, and later with super-team the Justice League of
                        America. In response,
                        publisher Martin Goodman assigned Lee to come up with a new superhero team. Lee's wife suggested
                        that he experiment with
                        stories he preferred, since he was planning on changing careers and had nothing to lose. Lee
                        acted
                        on that advice, giving his superheroes a flawed humanity, a change from the ideal
                        archetypes that were
                        typically written for preteens. Before this, most superheroes were idealistically perfect people
                        with no serious,
                        lasting problems.Lee introduced complex, naturalistic characters who could have bad
                        tempers, fits of
                        melancholy, and vanity; they bickered amongst themselves, worried about paying their bills and
                        impressing girlfriends,
                        got bored or were even sometimes physically ill.
                    </p>
                    <br />
                    <p>
                        He graduated from writing filler to actual comics with a backup feature, "'Headline' Hunter,
                        Foreign
                        Correspondent", two
                        issues later. Lee's first superhero co-creation was the Destroyer, in Mystic Comics #6 (August
                        1941). Other characters
                        he co-created during this period fans and historians call the Golden Age of Comic Books include
                        Jack
                        Frost, debuting in
                        U.S.A. Comics #1 (August 1941), and Father Time, debuting in Captain America Comics #6 (August
                        1941).

                        When Simon and his creative partner Jack Kirby left late in 1941, following a dispute with
                        Goodman,
                        the 30-year-old
                        publisher installed Lee, just under 19 years old, as interim editor. The youngster showed
                        a knack for the
                        business that led him to remain as the comic-book division's editor-in-chief, as well as art
                        director for much of that
                        time, until 1972, when he would succeed Goodman as publisher.

                        Stan Lee appears in one panel as "third assistant office boy" in Terry-Toons #12 (September
                        1943).
                        Stan Lee is featured
                        prominently as a story character in Margie #36 (June 1947).

                        Lee and Jack Kirby appear as themselves in The Fantastic Four #10 (January 1963), the first of
                        several appearances
                        within the fictional Marvel Universe. The two are depicted as similar to their real-world
                        counterparts, creating
                        comic books based on the "real" adventures of the Fantastic Four.

                    <p>
                        Lee was shown in numerous cameo appearances in many Marvel titles, appearing in audiences and

                        at many characters'
                        ceremonies and parties. For example, he is seen hosting an old-soldiers reunion in Sgt. Fury and

                        Howling Commandos

                        Lee) a story set in an
                        abandoned circus. This characterization was revived in Marvel's "Flashback" series of titles
